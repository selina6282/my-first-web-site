<p>UNDP’s mandate is to end poverty, build democratic governance, rule of law, and inclusive institutions.<br>
We advocate for change, and connect countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life.<br>
The organization was created in 1969, the same year the United Nations General Assembly declared “parents have the exclusive right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.”<br> </p>
